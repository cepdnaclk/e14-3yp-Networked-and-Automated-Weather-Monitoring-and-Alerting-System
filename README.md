## Introduction

Weather conditions and climate changes must be logged and analyzed by relevant authorities like meteorological department each day. They take relevant actions observing those records obtained allover the island. But in the current manual system they collect information only from main cities and  taking responses manually takes much time and effort.

So in this unified project we develop a system that can be used to collect information from much many places allover Sri Lanka using an embedded system kept in those locations. The locations may be places in each district close to sea, rivers, reservoirs, tanks and other areas. The data are wind speed, rain status, rainfall, humidity, temperature etc.

All those data taken from those sensors, are sent to a central server and processed there. If there are extreme weather cases, public must be warned. So the web application gives instant alerts to it's users including relevant central authorities as well as regional authorities. The process is very quicker than manual method. So the damages due to extreme weather is reduced as well as meteorological department will have newest data from allover the country.
